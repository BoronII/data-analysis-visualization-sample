# All of these will be implemented as methods in the class

# Common steps in preprocessing:
# 1. Drop cols (list of to_drop columns)
# 2. Drop rows that have nan values in a particular column
# 3. Rename entries in a column from a dict
# 4. Rename columns from a dict
# 5. Functionality to use the same dict for a list of columns
# 6. Save processed data frames

# Tests
# 1. check to make sure that columns have Nans in the same places before and after renaming

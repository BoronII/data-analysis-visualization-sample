# data-analysis-visualization-sample

In this repository I will do some cleaning, visualization and analysis of some public opinion datasets.
This work will be done in Python relying on the plotly and seaborn packages for visualization.
All of the notebooks pertaining to the data sets are contained in the notebooks folder. 
The scripts (for cleaning a visualization) are contained in the scripts folder.
Text files containing the exposition can be found in the exposition folder.
